                A <strong> QR code</strong> (an initialism for Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or
                two-dimensional barcode)invented in 1994 by the Japanese automotive company Denso Wave. A barcode is a
                machine-readable optical label that can contain information about the item to which it is attached.
                A QR code is a machine-readable optical label that contains information. Its a barcode, basically. With
                a slight difference: its two-dimensional. Read our How Do QR Codes Work? post for a more technical
                version.A traditional, one-dimensional barcode (see below) is scanned by a narrow beam of light. That
                beam of light comes from a specialized scanner. The vertical bars in a one-dimensional barcode are where
                the information is encoded. Specifically, in their widths and their distances from each other. Thats why
                its called a one-dimensional barcode; scanners access the information in one dimension, horizontally.
                <br>
                But qr codes contain information accessible along two Dimensions: horizontal and vertical. A QR code is
                a square made up of patterns of smaller squares. Information in a QR code is encoded by the arrangement
                of these smaller Squares. And, once scanned, it delivers information just like other barcodes.

            <h2>WHAT IS IT'S WORKING ?</h2>
            <p>
                A <strong>QR code</strong> consists of black squares arranged in a square grid on a white background,
                which can be read by an imaging device such as a camera, and processed using Reed–Solomon error
                correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data is then extracted from
                patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.

            <p>
                QR codes are now used in a much broader context, including both commercial tracking applications and
                convenience-oriented applications aimed at mobile-phone users (termed mobile tagging). QR codes may be
                used to display text to the user, to open a webpage on the user's device, to add a vCard contact to the
                user's device, to open a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), to connect to a wireless network, or to
                compose an email or text message. There are a great many QR code generators available as software or as
                online tools that are either free, or require a paid subscription2 The QR code has become one of the
                most-used types of two-dimensional code.

            <h2 class="edit">Two Types of QR Code :- </h2>
            <p>
                A QR code is either a static or dynamic QR code. The difference has to do with the way they store
                information.

            <div class="type" style="background-color: #923cb5;
            background-image: linear-gradient(147deg, #923cb5 0%, #000000 74%);">

                    What Is a Static QR Code?
                </h4>
                <br><br>

                A static QR code is a fixed, uneditable QR code. The more information you store, the bigger and more
                complex a static QR code is. With large or complicated sets of characters, a static QR code can look
                very busy and take slightly longer to scan.
                <br><br>
                But the biggest drawback to using a static QR code isn’t QR code size or speed. It’s editability. Once
                you learn how to make a QR code and create a static QR code, it can’t be edited. The information in the
                code cannot be changed until and unless you create a brand new QR code.
                <br><br>
                They’re best used for simple data and one-time use scenarios. Like ID numbers, product or serial
                numbers, or check-in information for hotels or events.
                <br><br>

                <h4 class="edit">
                    What Is a Dynamic QR Code?
                </h4>
                <br><br>

                A dynamic QR code is a QR code that can be edited after creation. As many times as you want. That means
                you can change the information encoded in a dynamic QR code without having to create and distribute new
                QR codes.
                <br><br>
                They do it by changing a short redirection URL to a QR code. Upon scanning, users are taken to the URL
                where they see the information. Because their data modules include only a single URL, dynamic QR codes
                are simpler and tend to scan and load quickest. They also track QR code usage—an indispensable quality
                for QR code marketing.
                <br><br>
                For most applications, dynamic QR codes are your best bet. They’re not any more complicated to create
                than static QR codes, and they’re much more versatile. Certainly any QR code uses that require editing
                information (think of consistently changing coupons or digital menus) and tracking must use dynamic QR
                codes. Also, QR codes that need to scan quick and be small, like QR code nutritional information or food
                labels, should go dynamic.

            <h2 class="edit">vCard QR Code</h2>
            <p>
                A vCard QR code is a QR code that contains a vCard file. A vCard, or virtual contact card, is the
                standard
                file format for electronic business cards. Within each vCard can be a name, title, logo, photo, phone
                numbers, physical addresses, and email addresses.
                <br>
                Historically, vCards have been sent and received via email, text message, or instant message. But QR
                codes
                have made transferring basic contact information much quicker and easier.

                <br><br>
                BinWise’s QR code-based digital menu does just that. All bars, restaurants, and hotels have to do is
                click and drag a spreadsheet of basic information about their menu inventory on it. The rest is taken
                care of we’ve even got free QR code templates and resources for putting your QR code on tables). And
                you’re left with a beautiful new QR code and a customized digital menu that you can share with the
