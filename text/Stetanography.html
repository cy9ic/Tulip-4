        <h2>STEGANOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p><strong>Steganography</strong> is the use of various methods to hide information from unwanted eyes. In
            ancient times, steganography was mostly done physically.
            The oldest documented case of steganography dates to 500 BC, in which Histiaeus, the ruler of Milteus,
            tattooed a message on the shaved head of one of his slaves
            and let the hair grow back. He then sent the slave to the Aristagoras, his son-in-law, who shaved the
            slave's head again and revealed the message
            In the centuries that followed, more modern forms of steganography were invented, such as invisible inks.
        <p> Today, steganography has moved to the digital world.
            “Steganography by definition is the hiding of one file within another,” says Ira Winkler, lead security
            principal at Trustwave.Steganography (/ˌstɛɡəˈnɒɡrəfi/
            (audio speaker iconlisten) STEG-ə-NOG-rə-fee) is the practice of concealing a message within another message
            or a physical object. In computing/electronic contexts,
            a computer file, message, image, or video is concealed within another file, message, image, or video. The
            word steganography comes from Greek steganographia, which
            combines the words stegare, meaning "covered or concealed", and -graphia (γραφή) meaning "writing".
            The first recorded use of the term was in 1499 by Johannes Trithemius in his Steganographia, a treatise on
            cryptography and steganography, disguised as a book on magic. </p>

        May be in invisible ink between the visible lines of a private letter. Some implementations of steganography
        that lack a shared secret are forms of security through obscurity,
        and key-dependent steganographic schemes adhere to Kerckhoffs's principle.
        The advantage of steganography over cryptography alone is that the intended secret message does not attract
        attention to itself as an object of scrutiny. Plainly visible encrypted messages,
        no matter how unbreakable they are, arouse interest and may in themselves be incriminating in countries in
        which encryption is illegal.
        <p>
            Whereas cryptography is the practice of protecting the contents of a message alone, steganography is
            concerned with concealing the fact that a secret message is being sent and its contents.
            Steganography includes the concealment of information within computer files. In digital steganography,
            electronic communications may include steganographic coding inside of a transport layer,
            such as a document file, image file, program, or protocol. Media files are ideal for steganographic
            transmission because of their large size. For example, a sender might start with an innocuous
            image file and adjust the color of every hundredth pixel to correspond to a letter in the alphabet. The
            change is so subtle that someone who is not specifically looking for it is unlikely to notice the change.

        <h2>HOW IT WORKS ?</h2>
        <img class="main" src="https://cdn-blog.adafruit.com/uploads/2021/07/1624982993628-4-cryptography-600x299.jpg"
            alt="working">
        <p>
            Steganography works by hiding information in a way that doesn't arouse suspicion. One of the most popular
            techniques is 'least significant bit (LSB) steganography. In this type of steganography, the information
            hider
            embeds the secret information in the least significant bits of a media file
            For instance, in an image file each pixel is comprised of three bytes of data corresponding to the colors
            red,
            green, and blue (some image formats allocate an additional fourth byte to transparency, or 'alpha').
            LSB steganography changes the last bit of each of those bytes to hide one bit of data. So, to hide one
            megabyte
            of data using this method, you'll need an eight-megabyte image file.
        <p>
            Since modifying the last bit of the pixel value doesn't result in a visually perceptible change to the
            picture,
            a person viewing the original and the steganographically modified images won't be able to tell the
            difference.

        <p>
            The first recorded uses of steganography can be traced back to 440 BC in Greece, when Herodotus mentions two
            examples in his Histories. Histiaeus sent a message to his vassal, Aristagoras, by shaving the head of his
            most
            trusted servant, "marking" the message onto his scalp,
            then sending him on his way once his hair had regrown, with the instruction, "When thou art come to Miletus,
            bid
            Aristagoras shave thy head, and look thereon." Additionally, Demaratus sent a warning about a forthcoming
            attack
            to Greece by writing it directly on the wooden backing
            of a wax tablet before applying its beeswax surface. Wax tablets were in common use then as reusable writing
            surfaces, sometimes used for shorthand.
            In his work Polygraphiae, Johannes Trithemius developed his so-called "Ave-Maria-Cipher" that can hide
            information in a Latin praise of God. "Auctor Sapientissimus Conseruans Angelica Deferat Nobis Charitas
            Potentissimi Creatoris" for example contains the concealed word VICIPEDIA.

        <h1>Countermeasure And Dectection</h1>
        <p>
            Detecting physical steganography requires a careful physical examination, including the use of
            magnification,
            developer chemicals, and ultraviolet light. It is a time-consuming process with obvious resource
            implications,
            even in countries that employ many people to spy on their fellow nationals. However, it is feasible to
            screen
            mail of certain suspected
            individuals or institutions, such as prisons or prisoner-of-war (POW) camps.
            During World War II, prisoner of war camps gave prisoners specially-treated paper that would reveal
            invisible
            ink. An article in the 24 June 1948 issue of Paper Trade Journal by the Technical Director of the United
            States
            Government Printing Office had Morris S. Kantrowitz describe in general terms the development of this paper.
            Three prototype papers
            (Sensicoat, Anilith, and Coatalith) were used to manufacture postcards and stationery provided to German
            prisoners of war in the US and Canada. If POWs tried to write a hidden message, the special paper rendered
            it
            visible. The US granted at least two patents related to the technology, one to Kantrowitz, U.S. Patent
            2,515,232,

            In computing, steganographically encoded package detection is called steganalysis. The simplest method to
            detect
            modified files, however, is to compare them to known originals. For example, to detect information being
            moved
            through the graphics on a website, an analyst can maintain known clean copies of the materials and then
            compare
            contents of the site. The differences, if the carrier is the same, comprise the payload. In general, using
            extremely high compression rates makes steganography difficult but not impossible. Compression errors
            provide a
            hiding place for data, but high compression reduces the amount of data available to hold the payload,
            raising
            the encoding density, which facilitates
            easier detection (in extreme cases, even by casual observation).</p>
        There are a variety of basic tests that can be done to identify whether or not a secret message exists. This
        process is not concerned with the extraction of the message, which is a different process and a separate step.
        The most basic approaches of steganalysis are visual or aural attacks, structural attacks, and statistical
        attacks. These approaches attempt to detect
        the steganographic algorithms that were used. These algorithms range from unsophisticated to very sophisticated,
        with early algorithms being much easier to detect due to statistical anomalies that were present. The size of
        the message that is being hidden is a factor in how difficult it is to detect. The overall size of the cover
        object also plays a factor as well.
        If the cover object is small and the message is large,this can distort the statistics and make it easier to
        detect. A larger cover object with a small message decreases the statistics and gives it a better chance of
        going unnoticed.

            Steganalysis that targets a particular algorithm has much better success as it is able to key in on the
            anomalies that are left behind. This is because the analysis can perform a targeted search to discover known
            tendencies since it is aware of the behaviors that it commonly exhibits. When analyzing an image the least
            significant bits of many images are actually not random.
            The camera sensor, especially lower-end sensors are not the best quality and can introduce some random bits.
            This can also be affected by the file compression done on the image. Secret messages can be introduced into
            the
            least significant bits in an image and then hidden. A steganography tool can be used to camouflage the
            secret
            message in the least significant bits but it can introduce a random area that is too perfect.
            This area of perfect randomization stands out and can be detected by comparing the least significant bits to
            the
            next-to-least significant bits on an image that hasn't been compressed.
        </p>
        Generally, though, there are many techniques known to be able to hide messages in data using steganographic
        techniques. None are, by definition, obvious when users employ standard applications, but some can be detected
        by specialist tools. Others, however, are resistant to detection—or rather it is not possible to reliably
        distinguish data containing a hidden message from data containing just noise—even when the most sophisticated
        analysis is performed.
        Steganography is being used to conceal and deliver more effective cyber attacks, referred to as Stegware. The
        term Stegware was first introduced in 2017[54] to describe any malicious operation involving steganography as a
        vehicle to conceal an attack. Detection of steganography is challenging, and because of that, not an adequate
        defence. Therefore, the only way of defeating the threat is to transform data in a way that destroys any hidden
        messages, a process called Content Threat Removal.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in
        order to
        avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. The use of steganography can be
        combined 
        with encryption as an extra step for hiding or protecting data. The word steganography is derived from the
        Greek
        words steganos (meaning hidden or covered) and the Greek root graph (meaning to write).
        Steganography can be used to conceal almost any type of digital content, including text, image, video or
        audio
        content; the data to be hidden can be hidden inside almost any other type of digital content. The content to
        be
        concealed through steganography -- called hidden text -- is often encrypted before being incorporated into
        the
        innocuous-seeming cover text file or data stream. If not encrypted, the hidden text is commonly processed
        in some way in order to increase the difficulty of detecting the secret content.
